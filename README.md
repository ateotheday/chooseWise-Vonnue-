# chooseWise-Vonnue
A web-based application made as part of a take-home assessment conducted by Vonnue. This is a decision-making system built for making informed decisions between multiple options by evaluating specified criteria and the personality of the individuals..

MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM :
The goal of this assignment is not to build a static comparison tool or a black-box AI system, but to design a transparent and adaptable decision-making framework.
From my understanding, the core challenge is to create a system that:
Accepts multiple options

Allows dynamic criteria definition

Supports weighted importance

Produces a ranked recommendation

Clearly explains why a particular option was chosen

The system must avoid two extremes:

A hard-coded comparison engine with fixed criteria

A black-box AI model where decisions cannot be explained

Therefore, I interpreted the task as designing an adaptive decision model that evaluates options based on structured criteria, while incorporating user-specific traits such as personality and preference patterns.

-In my approach, decision outcomes are influenced by:

-Explicit user-defined importance (weights)

-Personality-based adjustments (e.g., risk tolerance, long-term orientation)

Context-specific criteria relevant to the type of decision
The objective of the system, in my understanding, is  to assist structured reasoning.
